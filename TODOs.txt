TODOs


	in terms of UX:

		- More clarity about "ideal" values, how to find them
		- Create dynamic previews at 200px, 300px, 400px, 600px in the widgets area, to help users quickly select the best width and height
		- Figure out how the [X] button on the leadbox is intended to work...
		- Create a WP shortcode so the leadbox can be deployed in post/page content
		- Make boxes start out pretty, not wait till page loads to scale properly


	in general:

		- Get feedback. Is the whole "scaling" css method a viable one? Is this really a "breakthrough" of some sort in making HTML scale and appear similar/identical at different widths, almost to the degree that images do?


	in terms of the technical:

		- extract iframe-generation to a render.php file
		- decide whether this plugin is primarily for iframes, or also for other code blocks, and adjust functionality and UX naming accordingly
		- figure out just how badly / how recently this fails on crap browsers (IE)... and figure out graceful fail-plans
		- write a readme file
		- make sure widget expansion never makes the widget get bigger than the device width.
		- add a clearfix after the widget; esp. relevant when pulled into pages.
		- security: filter input, escape output. (or something like that)
